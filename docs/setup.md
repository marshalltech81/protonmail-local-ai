# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- macOS with Docker Desktop installed and running
- Claude Desktop installed
- Proton Mail paid account (Bridge requires a paid plan)
- Git configured with SSH key for GitHub

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marshalltech81/protonmail-local-ai.git
cd protonmail-local-ai
```

### 2. Create your environment file and secret placeholders

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` — you can leave `BRIDGE_USER` blank for now.
You will fill it in after the Bridge login step.

Create the secrets directory and placeholder files:

```bash
make init-secrets
```

This creates `.secrets/bridge_pass.txt` and `.secrets/anthropic_api_key.txt`
as empty placeholders with `600` permissions. Docker Compose requires both files
to exist before starting. You will overwrite them with real values:

- `bridge_pass.txt` — after the Bridge login step below
- `anthropic_api_key.txt` — only if you use `LLM_MODE=cloud`; leave empty for local-only mode

### 3. Build all Docker images

```bash
make build
```

The Bridge image compiles from the official Proton source (`make build-nogui`).
This takes approximately 3–5 minutes on first build.
Subsequent builds use Docker layer cache and are much faster.

### 4. First-time Bridge login

This step only ever runs once. Your credentials persist in the `bridge-data`
Docker volume.

```bash
make first-run
```

Inside the interactive Bridge CLI:

```
>>> login
# Enter your Proton email address
# Enter your Proton account password
# Enter your 2FA code if enabled

>>> info
# Note the Username and Password shown — these are your Bridge credentials
# They are different from your Proton account password

>>> exit
```

Copy the displayed `Username` into your `.env` file:

```bash
BRIDGE_USER=your@proton.me          # from info → Username
```

Write the `Password` into the Docker secret file:

```bash
printf '%s' 'bridge-generated-pass' > .secrets/bridge_pass.txt
chmod 600 .secrets/bridge_pass.txt
```

Do not put the Bridge password in `.env` — it is passed to the mbsync container
exclusively via Docker Compose secrets, mounted at `/run/secrets/bridge_pass`.

**Why this step is manual (design note)**

The Bridge password lives inside `vault.enc`, which is encrypted with a key held
in the GPG-backed `pass` store. It would be technically possible to automate
extraction by reimplementing the vault format (msgpack framing, AES-256-GCM,
sha256 key derivation). This is intentionally avoided for two reasons:

1. **Fragility.** The vault format is a Bridge internal. Proton can change the
   framing, cipher parameters, or key derivation in any release without notice.
   External decryption code would break silently or produce garbage.

2. **Unnecessary.** The Bridge CLI (`bridge-v3 info`) already reads the vault
   through the supported code path and prints the Bridge credentials. The
   manual copy from that output is a one-time, human-in-the-loop step that
   is appropriate for a first-run flow requiring interactive login anyway.

If you want a shortcut, run this after the `login` / `info` steps above to
print the password directly:

```bash
docker compose run --rm protonmail-bridge \
  su -s /bin/bash bridge -c 'bridge-v3 info'
```

### 5. Pull Ollama models

```bash
make pull-models
```

This pulls:
- `nomic-embed-text` — embedding model for search (~274MB)
- `llama3.2` — local LLM for Q&A (~2GB)

### 6. Start the full stack

```bash
make up
```

Verify everything is running:

```bash
make logs
```

You should see:
- `protonmail-bridge` — "Starting Bridge in noninteractive mode"
- `mbsync` — "Bridge IMAP is ready" then "Syncing..."
- `indexer` — "Running initial index scan..."
- `ollama` — serving on port 11434
- `mcp-server` — "MCP server starting on port 3000"

The initial index scan may take several minutes depending on mailbox size.

The default MCP deployment is read-only:
- search, retrieval, and intelligence tools use the local SQLite index
- mail-changing action tools are not registered until a safe write path is explicitly enabled

On first run, Bridge must download and decrypt your full mailbox from Proton's
servers before mbsync can pull anything. This can take a long time for large
mailboxes. Watch sync progress with:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data:/data:ro \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    bash -c 'find /data/local/protonmail/bridge-v3/logs -name "*.log" | sort | tail -1 | xargs tail -f'
```

Bridge writes sync progress into its structured log file in the `bridge-data`
volume.

## Updating Bridge

When you bump `BRIDGE_VERSION` in `.env`, validate the upstream patch points and
the rebuilt image before restarting the service:

```bash
make bridge-upgrade-check
make update
```

### 7. Configure Claude Desktop

Open or create `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "protonmail-local-ai": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/sse"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop.

In a new conversation, you should see the ProtonMail tools available.
Test with: *"What is the status of my email index?"*

## Troubleshooting

### Bridge won't start — "Failed to launch exit status 1"

This can happen if the image is outdated. Check:

```bash
docker compose logs protonmail-bridge
```

If the image is outdated, rebuild:

```bash
make bridge-upgrade-check
make update
```

### Bridge won't start — keychain / GPG errors

```bash
docker compose logs protonmail-bridge
```

If the GPG/pass store is corrupt, wipe the bridge data volume and re-run first-run:

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data
make first-run
```

### Bridge starts but shows "No Proton account found" every time

The account detection looks for `vault.enc` in the bridge-data volume.
If it keeps dropping to the interactive CLI, the volume may not be persisting correctly:

```bash
docker volume inspect protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data
```

Ensure `make first-run` uses `docker compose run` (not `docker run`) so the named
volume is mounted.

### Startup warnings: "Failed to add test credentials to keychain" / "no vault key found"

These are harmless. Bridge cannot use the desktop keychain (no dbus session in a
container) and falls back to its own encrypted vault. The "no vault key found" warning
only appears once — on the very first run before the vault is created.

### Reading Bridge logs directly from the volume

Bridge writes structured logs to a timestamped file inside the `bridge-data` volume.
Since Bridge no longer streams logs to Docker stdout, read them directly:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data:/data:ro \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    bash -c 'find /data/local/protonmail/bridge-v3/logs -name "*.log" | sort | tail -1 | xargs tail -n 100'
```

To follow the log in real time, replace `tail -n 100` with `tail -f`.

### Bridge is up but IMAP is unresponsive / mbsync can't connect

Bridge may still be in the middle of its initial Gluon sync — pulling every
message body from Proton's API into its local database before it can serve IMAP.
This is not the same as mbsync syncing to Maildir. It happens inside the Bridge
container and can take hours on a large mailbox.

Run these three diagnostics to understand what state Bridge is in:

**1. Check recent Bridge logs**

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data:/data:ro \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    bash -c 'find /data/local/protonmail/bridge-v3/logs -name "*.log" | sort | tail -1 | xargs tail -n 30'
```

If you see rapid-fire lines like:

```
200 OK: GET https://mail-api.proton.me/mail/v4/messages/<id>
200 OK: GET https://mail-api.proton.me/mail/v4/messages/<id>
```

Bridge is still downloading messages. Do not attempt cert extraction yet —
IMAP will be unresponsive during heavy Gluon sync, and `mbsync` now fails
closed and retries instead of syncing without a pinned Bridge cert.

**2. Check that Bridge is authenticated**

```bash
docker exec protonmail-bridge \
    find /data/config/protonmail/bridge-v3 -type f | sort
```

If `vault.enc` is missing, Bridge is not authenticated and will not serve IMAP
at all. Re-run `make first-run` to log in again.

**3. Check the bridge binary is actually running**

```bash
docker exec protonmail-bridge ps aux
```

A container can be "Up" while the process inside has crashed. If `bridge` does
not appear in `ps aux`, the process exited — check the logs for the error and
restart the container.

**How to know Gluon sync is finished**

Watch for the log pattern to shift from message fetching to event polling:

```
# Still syncing — rapid fire, sub-second interval:
200 OK: GET .../mail/v4/messages/<id>
200 OK: GET .../mail/v4/messages/<id>

# Sync complete — sparse, several seconds apart:
200 OK: GET .../mail/v4/events/<id>
200 OK: POST .../data/v1/metrics
```

Once you see event polling instead of message fetching, IMAP is fully
responsive. Extract the TLS cert (see below) and then check mbsync.

**Confirm IMAP port is actually accepting connections**

Run this from outside the container to verify port 1143 is ready:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    --network protonmail-local-ai_bridge-net \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    bash -c "apt-get install -y netcat-openbsd -qq 2>/dev/null && \
             echo | nc -w 5 protonmail-bridge 1143"
```

If IMAP is ready you will see the Bridge greeting banner, e.g.:

```
* OK [CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 ...] ProtonMail Bridge ready.
```

If the command hangs or exits silently, Bridge is still syncing or the
process has crashed — check the logs and process steps above.

### Verifying mbsync is working

Run these checks in order of depth.

**1. Is mbsync running and looping?**

```bash
docker compose logs mbsync --tail 20
```

Look for `>>> Syncing...` lines repeating at your `SYNC_INTERVAL`. If you see
`>>> Bridge IMAP is ready.` but no sync output, something failed silently.

**2. Did any mail land in the Maildir volume?**

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v protonmail-local-ai_maildir-volume:/maildir:ro \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    find /maildir -name "*.eml" -o -name "*:2,*" | wc -l
```

A non-zero count means mbsync is writing files. Zero means it connected but
downloaded nothing — either the mailbox is empty or `Patterns` is filtering
everything out.

**3. Check the folder structure was created**

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -v protonmail-local-ai_maildir-volume:/maildir:ro \
    debian:bookworm-slim \
    find /maildir -maxdepth 2 -type d
```

You should see `INBOX`, `Sent`, `Drafts`, etc. If only `/maildir` appears with
nothing under it, the sync ran but Bridge returned no folders.

**4. Force a sync now and watch verbose output**

```bash
docker exec mbsync mbsync -c /tmp/mbsync/mbsyncrc -a -V 2>&1 | head -50
```

`-V` prints each folder being synced and message counts. This is the most
informative test — it will clearly show auth failures, cert errors, or folder
mismatches.

### mbsync fails to connect

Bridge takes 10–15 seconds to fully start. mbsync waits automatically,
but if it keeps failing:

```bash
docker compose logs mbsync
docker compose logs protonmail-bridge
```

### Ollama container is unhealthy

The official `ollama/ollama` image does not include `curl` or `wget`.
The healthcheck uses `ollama list` — if you see repeated health failures, check:

```bash
docker inspect ollama --format='{{json .State.Health.Log}}'
```

### Ollama model not found

```bash
make pull-models
```

### sqlite-vec fails with "wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS32" (ARM64 / Apple Silicon)

You are running an older pinned version. `sqlite-vec` versions prior to 0.1.9 ship
an armv7 (32-bit) wheel which is incompatible with aarch64 containers. Ensure
both `indexer/pyproject.toml` and `mcp-server/pyproject.toml` pin
`sqlite-vec==0.1.9` or later, regenerate the lockfiles, then rebuild:

```bash
docker compose build indexer mcp-server
```

### Index is empty after startup

The initial sync may still be running. Check:

```bash
docker compose logs indexer
docker compose logs mbsync
```

mbsync must connect to Bridge and complete at least one sync before the indexer
has emails to process.

### Claude Desktop doesn't see the tools

1. Verify the MCP server is running: `docker compose ps`
2. Check the server is responding: `curl -N http://localhost:3000/sse`
3. Verify the Claude Desktop config JSON is valid (no trailing commas)
4. Restart Claude Desktop

### Bridge credentials expired / need to re-authenticate

```bash
make down
docker volume rm protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data
make first-run   # log in again
```

After login, copy the new `Username` into `.env` and write the new `Password`
into `.secrets/bridge_pass.txt`:

```bash
printf '%s' 'new-bridge-generated-pass' > .secrets/bridge_pass.txt
chmod 600 .secrets/bridge_pass.txt
make up
```

Your email index is in a separate volume (`sqlite-volume`) and is not affected.

### mbsync fails — TLS hostname mismatch after rebuilding Bridge image

The TLS cert Bridge generates is cached inside `vault.enc` in the `bridge-data` volume.
Rebuilding the image does not regenerate the cert — the old one (issued for `127.0.0.1`
only) is reused. To force a fresh cert with the correct SANs, delete `vault.enc` from
the volume without wiping the GPG/pass store:

```bash
make down
docker run --rm -v protonmail-local-ai_bridge-data:/data debian:bookworm-slim \
    rm -f /data/config/protonmail/bridge-v3/vault.enc
make first-run   # re-login; Bridge generates a new cert with protonmail-bridge SAN
make up
```
